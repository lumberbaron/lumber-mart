## Script Invocation

All Python skill scripts are invoked as modules from `scripts/`:

<invoke working-dir=".claude/skills/scripts" cmd="python3 -m skills.<skill_name>.<module> --step 1 --total-steps N" />

Example:

<invoke working-dir=".claude/skills/scripts" cmd="python3 -m skills.problem_analysis.analyze --step 1 --total-steps 5" />
